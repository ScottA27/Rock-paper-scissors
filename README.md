### Bugs 

#### Solved Bugs

* The initial code for the "checkwinner" function within the javascript didn't work how I had 
intended. The code would only push certain messages, this was due to me inserting 2 equals signs
to display a message when I should have only been using 1.

#### Unfixed Bugs 

* No unfixed bugs.

* HTML
    * There were no errors when checked through the official W3C validator.

    * There were no errors when checked through the official W3C CSS validator (Jigsaw).
